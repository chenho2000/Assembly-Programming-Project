# Assembly Programming Project: Doodle Jump
In this project, we will implement the popular mobile game Doodle Jump using MIPS assembly. You may play a version of the original game at this link.

Since we don't have access to a physical computer with a MIPS processor, we will test our implementation in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input. The video below is the demonstration of a basic version of the game running in the simulator. As you can see in the keyboard-input window at the bottom of the screen, the player presses the key "j" to make the Doodler move to the left and pressed the key "k" move to the right, When no key is pressed, the Doodler falls straight down until it hits a platform or the bottom of the screen. If it hits a platform, the Doodler bounces up high into the air, but if the Doodler hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
